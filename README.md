# BankMarketing
This project aimed to predict whether a customer would subscribe to a term deposit after a phone call, using data science techniques. To do this, we analyzed a dataset from a telemarketing campaign, integrating customer information (age, occupation, banking history) as well as economic indicators (interest rates, consumer confidence). One of the main challenges encountered was class imbalance, as the vast majority of customers refused the offer. To correct this, we applied the SMOTE technique to rebalance the data, then tested several machine learning models, including Random Forest and XGBoost, optimizing their parameters to improve the quality of the predictions.

The results obtained are generally satisfactory, with an accuracy of around 92%. However, we found that the variable "duration", which represents the duration of the call, had a determining influence on the predictions. However, since this information is only available after the call, it limits the practical application of the model in real situations. By removing this variable, the model's ability to identify customers likely to subscribe decreases considerably, which shows that it would be relevant to explore other variables available upstream. This project thus highlights the importance of a good selection of variables in order to guarantee predictions that are both reliable and exploitable, with the aim of optimizing banking marketing campaigns and improving customer relations.
